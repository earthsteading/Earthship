# preperatory checklist for structural supporting systems

The following standards/legisative documents are used in the below checklists:
  * AS 1170.4 = Earthquake action.
  * AS/NZS 1170.2 and AS 4055 = wind/cyclonic action
  * AS 1289.7.1.1, AS 1289.7.1.2 and
  * AS 1289.7.1.3. = soil reactivity
  * AS 1684 = pads for stumps or piers
  * AS/NZS 2904 = damp-proofing material compliance
  * AS 2870-2011: Residential slabs and footings
  * AS/NZS 2699.1:2000: Built-in components for masonry construction

## footings

  - [x] Testing of soil for stability and classified as: 
  - [ ] Aggregate material laid down below the concrete slab
  - [ ] Vapour barriers and damp-proofing membranes, i.e. 0.2 mm thick polyethylene film
  - [ ] which kind of slab to be used: size dependent.
  - [ ] type of concrete (strength), e.g. N20
  - [ ] depth of footings and rebar reinforcement
  - [ ] connection between footing and slab, e.g. rebar and N10/R10 ties/fitments at 900mm spacing
  - [ ] rebar reinforcement mesh placement and type
  - [ ] thickness of slab requirement = 
  - [ ] increase of slab for embedded hot water heating pipes
  - [ ] connetion between footing and wall framing
  - [ ] type of wall framing (aka insulation R value for climate), e.g.stud framed (R=1.7-19), brick veneer (R=1.9-2.2), double brick (R=2.1-2.3), etc.
  - [ ]  

## wall systems
The Earthship has two kinds of walls: a.) mortar walls built using earth rammed tyres, and b.) stud timber framed walls with glazing.

### masonry wall with rammed earth blocks

 - [ ] 3 of the 4 walls will be built using rammed earth tyres with a supporting/butressing earth burm.
 - [ ] rammed earth tyres size/shape = tyre schedule 
 - [ ] placement of cooling tubes (see ventilation system below)
 - [ ] concrete / hempcrete, 
 - [ ] bottle wall
 - [ ] render over tyre and bottle walls.
 - [ ] color of final render finish.
 - [ ] concrete mortar render and fire seal.

### framing wall
  * timber frame with glazing for atrium
  * traditional timber framed wall with plaster board
  * timber frame with hempcrete infill

### 3D printed clay/mortar wall
  * stay tuned ;-)

## ventilation systems
An earthship is a living building which is designed to leverage the natural physics of the planet to both heat and cool the building in relation to it occupants (homeostatsis).  Therefore, the following systems 
 - [ ] azimuth - passive heating
 - [ ] cooling tubes - passive cooling
 - [ ] thermocline / greenhouse
 - [ ] exhaust fans
 - [ ] fireplace / Australian flora is prone to fire for its expansion and survival...
 - [ ] digital monitorring, automation and rules of ventilation systems

## floor systems

 - [ ] concrete slab (AS2870 residential slabs and footings)
 - [ ] oxidisation of cement floor
 - [ ] underfloor heating (see also _________)

## roof system
The typical earthship is built with a timber roof utilisng the following materials and standards for the build:
 - [ ] [optional] if you have an architect, request a 'roof framing plan' including timber schedule to show compliance and ease in assembly by builder/carpenter. 
 - [ ] The roof is supported by two structural walls: the "front wall" which is timber framed and contains the north facing (azimuth) atrium windows, and the back berm wall made up of earth rammed tires.  Both of these walls must be made to the engineering requirements described in NCC/BCA vol.2 Section 3.4 Framing.
 - [ ] Bond beam between the rammed earth tires and the wood roof framing to structurally connect the supporting back berm wall and the roof system. 
 - [ ] The simplest design of the roof system is a monopitch truss, however greater roof distances can be spanded using other truss systems.
 - [ ] [optional] if your earthship design has multiple rooms a structural engineer may be required to provide a butress to provide bracing against the back berm wall to assure the earth berm wall does not collapse under the load of the roof.
 - [ ] The major structural roof beams will need to be engineered timber, e.g. laminated veneer lumber (LVL), I-joist, glue laminated lumber (glulam), cross laminated timber, etc. NB these structural beams are expensive and require pre-order well in advance to allow for 
 - [ ] Ask your surveyor or carpenteer to calculate load of the roof structure by using AS1684.2 (2010 Timber Framed Construction, either vol.1 for windy areas, or vol.2 for normal wind). Don't forget to include load of roof, e.g. roof fixtures, solar panels, sky lights, chimneys, snow/rain/wind load, etc.
 - [ ] Once roof load is calculated (based on type of wood you are using, ideally hardwood for bushfire zone fire rating level) calculate the number of rafters which will be required along with their spacing, ask your surveyor to calculate spacing and fastener (nail/screw) distance via AS 1720.5:2015: Timber structures.
 - [ ] [optional] for cyclone zones and/or high wind areas utilise roof/collar ties to secure all braces, battens, perlins, rafters and/or lintels.
 - [ ] For roof insulation, ask your surveyor to calculate the R-value which will be required for your climate/weather, including projections for 100 year climate change models.
 - [ ] roof sheathing / sarking for water proofing, vapour proofing, breathing (vapour permeable), or thermal reflectance, and which conforms with NCC vol.2 clause 3.10.
Source - AS 3959:2018: Construction of buildings in bushfire-prone areas 
 - [ ] roof-cladding (flashing)
 - [ ] roof attachments, including fans, flue, exhaust, vent, sky lights, brackets for solar panels/heating, etc.
 - [ ] roof water systems including gutters, flashings, valleys, ridging, weathering, rainwater piping and downpipes designed to collect or convey water discharged from roofs
Source - AS/NZS 3500.0:2003: Plumbing and drainage, (see also _________)
 - [ ] connection of roof system to drainage and (water management system)[].

## environmental systems

 - [ ] Wind zones in Australia: 
 - [ ] Alpine zones in Australia
