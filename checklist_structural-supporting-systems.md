# preperatory checklist for structural supporting systems

## inspector/certifier required documentation

 - [x] masonry
 - [x] floor systems
 - [x] roof systems
 - [x] ventilation systems
 - [x] wall systems
   - [x] framing (timber/hemcrete) systems
 - [x] cyclone/alpine systems

## masonry

AS 2870-2011: Residential slabs and footings
AS/NZS 2699.1:2000: Built-in components for masonry construction

 - [ ] rammed earth / earthwall, concrete / hempcrete, weatherproofing/flashing
 - [ ] foobar

## floor systems

 - [ ] slab (AS2870 residential slabs and footings)
 - [ ] oxidisation of cement floor
 - [ ] underfloor heating (see also _________)

## roof systems
An earthship is designed 
 - [ ] bond beam
 - [ ] truss / beams
 - [ ] rafters / roof truss /  - AS 1720.5:2015: Timber structures
 - [ ] roof tie / collar tie
 - [ ] insulation
 - [ ] roof sheathing / sarking
 - [ ] roof-cladding (flashing)
 - [ ] fan, flue, exhaust, vent, brackets for solar panels/heating
 - [ ] roof water systems including gutters, flashings, valleys, ridging, weathering, rainwater piping and downpipes designed to collect or convey water discharged from roofs
Source - AS/NZS 3500.0:2003: Plumbing and drainage, (see also _________)
 - [ ] wind rating (see also cyclone systems, below)

## ventilation systems
An earthship is a living building which is designed to leverage the natural physics of the planet to both heat and cool the building in relation to it occupants (homeostatsis).  Therefore, the following systems 
 - [ ] azimuth - passive heating
 - [ ] cooling tubes - passive cooling
 - [ ] thermocline / greenhouse
 - [ ] exhaust fans
 - [ ] fireplace / Australian flora is prone to fire for its expansion and survival...
 - [ ] digital monitorring, automation and rules of ventilation systems

## wall systems
The Earthship has two kinds of walls: a.) earth rammed tyres, and b.) stud wall

Rammed earth tire wall
 - [ ] tires (sizes/shape)
 - [ ] levels 
 - [ ] 
 - [ ] render 

### framing systems

Stud wall
 - [ ] footings
 - [ ] rebarb
 - [ ] 

## [regional/environmental variables] cyclone/alpine systems

 - [ ] Wind zones in Australia: 
 - [ ] Alpine zones in Australia
