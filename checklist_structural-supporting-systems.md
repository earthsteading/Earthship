## masonry

AS 2870-2011: Residential slabs and footings
AS/NZS 2699.1:2000: Built-in components for masonry construction

 - [ ] rammed earth / earthwall, concrete / hempcrete, weatherproofing/flashing
 - [ ] foobar

## floor systems

 - [ ] slab (AS2870 residential slabs and footings)
 - [ ] oxidisation of cement floor
 - [ ] underfloor heating (see also _________)

## wall systems
The Earthship has two kinds of walls: a.) earth rammed tyres, and b.) stud wall

Rammed earth (back berm) tyre wall
 - [ ] tires (sizes/shape)
 - [ ] levels 
 - [ ] 
 - [ ] render 

Wood framed front wall
  - [ ] nogging 

### framing systems

Stud wall
 - [ ] footings
 - [ ] rebarb
 - [ ] 

## roof system
The typical earthship is built with a timber roof utilisng the following materials and standards for the build:
 - [ ] The roof is supported by two structural walls: the "front wall" which is timber framed and contains the north facing (azimuth) atrium windows, and the back berm wall made up of earth rammed tires.  Both of these walls must be made to the engineering requirements described in NCC/BCA vol.2 Section 3.4 Framing.
 - [ ] Bond beam between the rammed earth tires and the wood roof framing to structurally connect the supporting back berm wall and the roof system. 
 - [ ] The simplest design of the roof system is a monopitch truss, however greater roof distances can be spanded using other truss systems.
 - [ ] [optional] if your earthship design has multiple rooms a structural engineer may be required to provide a butress to provide bracing against the back berm wall to assure the earth berm wall does not collapse under the load of the roof.
 - [ ] The major structural roof beams will need to be engineered timber, e.g. laminated veneer lumber (LVL), I-joist, glue laminated lumber (glulam), cross laminated timber, etc. NB these structural beams are expensive and require pre-order well in advance to allow for 
 - [ ] Ask your surveyor or carpenteer to calculate load of the roof structure by using AS1684.2 (2010 Timber Framed Construction, either vol.1 for windy areas, or vol.2 for normal wind). Don't forget to include load of roof, e.g. roof fixtures, solar panels, sky lights, chimneys, snow/rain/wind load, etc.
 - [ ] Once roof load is calculated (based on type of wood you are using, ideally hardwood for bushfire zone fire rating level) calculate the number of rafters which will be required along with their spacing, ask your surveyor to calculate spacing and fastener (nail/screw) distance via AS 1720.5:2015: Timber structures.
 - [ ] [optional] for cyclone zones and/or high wind areas utilise roof/collar ties to secure all battens, perlins, rafters and lintels.
 - [ ] For insulation, calculate the R-value which will be required for your climate/weather, including projections for 100 year climate change models.
 - [ ] 
 - [ ] roof sheathing / sarking
 - [ ] roof-cladding (flashing)
 - [ ] fan, flue, exhaust, vent, brackets for solar panels/heating
 - [ ] roof water systems including gutters, flashings, valleys, ridging, weathering, rainwater piping and downpipes designed to collect or convey water discharged from roofs
Source - AS/NZS 3500.0:2003: Plumbing and drainage, (see also _________)
 - [ ] wind rating (see also cyclone systems, below)

## ventilation systems
An earthship is a living building which is designed to leverage the natural physics of the planet to both heat and cool the building in relation to it occupants (homeostatsis).  Therefore, the following systems 
 - [ ] azimuth - passive heating
 - [ ] cooling tubes - passive cooling
 - [ ] thermocline / greenhouse
 - [ ] exhaust fans
 - [ ] fireplace / Australian flora is prone to fire for its expansion and survival...
 - [ ] digital monitorring, automation and rules of ventilation systems


## [regional/environmental variables] cyclone/alpine systems

 - [ ] Wind zones in Australia: 
 - [ ] Alpine zones in Australia
