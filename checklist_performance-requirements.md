# Performance Requirements for Earthships

There are several aspects of the Earthship build which will be questioned by Building Inspectors/Surveyors because they have not encountered the building methods before.  To *de-indemnify* the surveyor, you will need to provide evidence in the form of a "Performance Based Solution" (as defined by the National Construction Code).

*What is a Performance Solution?* -  The NCC allows for two methods to validate that a building has been built correctly: (a) a 'Deemed to Satisfy' solutions, and (b) a Performance Solution.  A deemed-to-satisfy solution is for age-old building methods (like timber framing), which is widely practiced and can be easily copied+pasted by the builder.  Performance Solutions are used when there are features of a building which are not as widely used, but can be shown to perform as well as (if not better) than the average deemed-to-satisfy building.

Naturally, the earthship design (despite being used by thousands of homes around the world since it's origins in the 1970s) requires additional evidence to prove that it is a valid solution which can perform just as well as modern day timber framed buildings.  

Below you will find Performance Solutions which you can use for your Earthship build, these performance solutions should be presented as part of your building schematics and be referenced accordingly so that when your buildling surveyor goes to inspect the plan and building they should have no questions about the building's ability to perform throughout all of Australasia.

## Below are "Performance Solutions" which have been accepted by councils for previous Earthship builds in Australia:

  - [x] [Lengthing of building via the earthen tyre wall being structurally extended by internal butresses](https://github.com/earthsteading/earthship/blob/master/performance-solution_earthen-tyre-wall-butress.md).
  - [x] [Energy efficiency (homeostasis) of passive solar design via atrium greenhouse and cooling tubes](https://github.com/earthsteading/earthship/blob/master/performance-solution_passive-homeostasis.md)
  - [ ] Civic construction of atrium and grey/black water management systems, e.g. septic, leach field and sandpit
  - [ ] Construction of stem wall with foundation pillars and inbuilt botanic water cell for atrium.
