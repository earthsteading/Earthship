# Performance Requirements for Earthships

There are several aspects of the Earthship build which will be questioned by Building Inspectors/Surveyors because they have not encountered the building methods before.  To *de-indemnify* the surveyor, you will need to provide evidence in the form of a "Performance Based Solution" (as defined by the [National Construction Code](https://ncc.abcb.gov.au/ncc-online/NCC/2019-A1/NCC-2019-Volume-Two-Amendment-1/Section-1-Governing-Requirements/Part-A2-Compliance-With-The-Ncc/A22-Performance-Solution?inlineLink=IDd1fe4824-fb0d-4ff0-abcb-ac7250fea486)).

## Below are checklists for the "Performance Solutions" which have been accepted for previous Earthship builds in Australia:

Structural integrity and safety:
  - [] Additional buttress support 
  - [] Stem wall protection of atrium wall from grey cell


### Performance Based Design Brief for Butreesses against earthen-tyre wall:

The buttresses on Earth#1 were used for a number of reasons (structural, health/amenity, aesthetic and accessibility)
  * The buttress feature was started by an American engineer which required them for structural integrity (ISO6707-1), thereby ensuring the structural integrity of the earth/tyre wall from Earthquakes and High Wind Regions (N3+). Subsequent engineers have determined that these buttresses are not required for areas in Australia with wind and/or Earthquake area.  Nonetheless, the buttresses provide 'peace of mind' for those who might experience hurricane force winds on the coast. See attached engineers report.
  * The Buttresses were used in Earth #1 primarily to solve health and amenity issues.  For example, they are used as the basis for mounting wall framework and solid mounting for hanging doors (which could also be achieved via other framing standards). The buttresses are over-engineered with internal steel reinforced rebar, which results in an internal wall system which is over-engineered for its use.
  * Design criteria: buttresses have become a core design feature of Earthships, alongside the bottle walls.  Buttresses, other than their ancient historical use in architecture, are also a feature of the Earth1, helping create division of space and a natural line of sight to the beautiful ceiling of Earth 1.  In short, the buttresses in Earth1 are a key aesthetic feature. 
  * Livability / accessibility: In addition to providing division between room, the concrete buttresses contrasted against the earthen adobe walls provide a perfect location for the wood heater as a thermal radiating mass.  While the exemplar energy efficiency (5 star) does not need the additional heat, it is still comforting to have a fire on the SouthCoast of Australia when Antarctic winds are blowing.
