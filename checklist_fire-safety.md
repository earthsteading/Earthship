### Bushfire Assessment Level and Fire Plan
It is assumed that most off-grid buildings in Australia should be built against the highest fire rating compliance called a "Bushfire Attack Level = Fire Zone (BAL-FZ).  Check with your building surveyor for cheaper options based on an official "BAL assessment". 
  - [ ] Bushfire Assessment Level = BAL40 --> BAL-FZ
  - [ ] Fire Plan: a.) shut fire shutters, b.) turn on drenching/soaking sprinkler system, c.) go to your designated fire safe facility. 
  - [ ] [Optional] bushfire shelters

## Documents required for inspector/certifier

  - [x] Bushfire => BAL certification
  - [x] Fire separation / compartments
  - [x] Smoke alarms
  - [x] Clearance/protection heating appliances => surveyor checked

### Fire seperation / compartments

  - [ ] Identification of potential fire risks next to building, e.g. fences, other buildings, etc.
  - [ ] Walls meet Fire Rated Level (FRL) requirements as defined by AS1530.4, i.e. 60/60/60 for structural (stability), integrity (from smoke/gas), insulation (from heat).
  - [ ] Automatic smoke/heat detection and alarm in each room/compartment.
  - [ ] Use of non combustable wall/ceiling material, e.g. plasterboard, fibre reinforced sheeting, Fire Rated Level (FRL) glass, etc.
  - [ ] Fire Rated Level (FRL) external walls (and/or +2m) between walls/buildings/structures.
  - [ ] Roof/sky lights seperated from boundary (internal fire compartment walls) and other roof fixtures by 900mm.
  - [ ] Services in seperating walls, e.g. wire/cables penetraing between walls/floor.

### Smoke alarms
  - [ ] Smoke alarms in every bedroom and connecting coordidoor/hallway ceiling and/or upper wall (either AS 3786-residential and/or AS 1670-commerical).
  - [ ] Smoke alarms cannot be placed in corners or other "enclosed/dead air spaces".
  - [ ] Smoke alarms with evacuation lighting for buildings being rented by temporary tenants. 
  - [ ] If connected to mains source power, then smoke alarms must be connected to mains source; otherwise, use of batter powered.
  - [ ] [optional] consider accessibility compliant smoke alarms for temporary disabled tennants, e.g. vibrations, strobe, etc.


### clearance/protection of heating appliances

  - [ ] stove/oven
  - [ ] fireplace
  - [ ] hydronic heating (floor / wall)
