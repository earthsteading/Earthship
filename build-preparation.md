# Overall preperatory site investigation (see below for detailed checklists and diagrams):
- [ ] drainage
- [ ] earthworks
- [ ] pest risk management
- [ ] soil assessment
- [ ] foundations & footings

Examples of the above requirements below:

## Drainage (functional design of integrated water: 

- [ ] proposed drainage lines, including: pipe sizes, pumps, gradients & levels (#! obtain engineer spec and plumber certificate)
      * PVC pipe = 100mm diameter in geofabric sock (AS 2002: Earth-retaining structures)
      * gradient = 1:100 fall
      * levels:
        * roof max/min/slope =
        * roof drainage height(s) = 
        * stormwater pit level = 
        * rainwater tank (main) = 
        * electric pump to header tank =
        * 
        * rainwater harvesting system (NCC) = 
- [ ] Discharge points
- [ ] Pits, sumps & draingae pits
- [ ] Wells and trenches
- [ ] Tanks (above and below ground level)
- [ ] Detention and un-detained areas, and detention system employed
- [ ] Pumps
- [ ] Pervious and impervious area identification
      * vapour barriers 
- [ ] Existing site and adjacent road levels
- [ ] Existing and proposed floor levels
- [ ] Existing site and proposed levels
- [ ] Direction flow
- [ ] Pollutant control devices

## Stormwater drainage requirements:
- [ ] Post development surface runoff from the design must not exceed pre-development run off from the site from a prescribed year ARI storm.
- [ ] No run-off shall be directed from the development site to adjacent properties.
- [ ] Floor levels, site works and drainage system shall be designed to provide 100 â€“ year ARI protection against inundation of buildings and any flood intolerant surfaces.
- [ ] Measures shall be incorporated within the site works along property boundaries to contain gutter flows.
- [ ] Measures shall be incorporated in all developments to ensure no stormwater borne pollutants (including litter, silt and any harmful substances) are discharged into any drainage system.
- [ ] Soakage systems shall be safely located, shall provide detention/retention and shall be environmentally appropriate.
- [ ] When a pump system is installed, the pump system failure must not result in inundation of any building or adjacent property, measures shall be incorporated to minimise the risk of failure during a storm.
- [ ] All drainage infrastructures within the development site shall be maintained, serviced, cleaned and sustained operational to the design requirements by the owner/management.
