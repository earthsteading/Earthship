# Performance Solution for earthen-tyre walls

The following Performance Solution is for presentation to your local council inspector and/or building surveyor to show that the foundation, footings and structural integrity of the rammed-earth-tyre wall out-performs the structural integrity of tranditional timber-framed construction.  The evidence presented in this _Performance Solution_ meets and exceeds the _Performance Requirements_ defined in the National Construction Code, Section B (Structure).

  * PBDB - a 'Performance Based Design Brief' is a collaborative process whereby stakeholders agree crtieria (aka performance requirements) for expert evaluation of an engineered 'performance solution'.
  * Performance Solution - is a set of 'Performance Requirements' which are agreed by a group of stakeholders to measure the safety of a proposed 'performance solution'.
  * Performance Requirement(s) - are the measures by which an agreed set of expert stakeholders agrees and evaluates to assure a 'performance solution' meets the requirements setout by the NCC for recognition as a 'performance solution'.

## Proposal summary
History of rammed earthen wall construction for structurally habitable buildings:
  * Evidence of rammed earth wall construction for habitable building walls has been archeologically documented in: (a) Mesopotamia Fertile Crescent, 7-9th century BCE (b) Yangshao & Longshan Yellow River settlement 5th century BCE, and (c) by the 2nd cetury BCE the use of rammed earth was documented by the Chinese Imperial court as it own construction practice "夯土 Hāng tǔ" meaning "rammed earth"  Subequently, every indigenous culture with settlement based dwellings has used rammed earth to achieve structural endurance.
  * Widespread use of rammed earth to build large community settlements with multiple stories is documented in: (a) Bam Iran aka Arg-e Bam, Persian from 5th cetury BCE, (b)  Pueblo Bonito in Chaco Canyon, built by the Indigenous Ancestral Puebloans in 3rd century BCE; and (c) when the Spanish conquistadors encountered Native American settlements in the 11th century, rammed earthen dwellings were widespread with over 600 dwellings (single occupancy units) which are still standing in the Anasazi cliff top of the Four Corners area, Colorado (USA); and (d) France (based on Roman occupation and construction) widely uses "pisé walls" (from the Latin origin "pisé de terre"). First documented and used in Lyons France 1562. 
  * 1925 US Department of Agriculture published a report for homesteading farmers showing evidence that "rammed earth structures endure indefinitely and can be constructed for less than two-thirds of the cost of standard frame houses".
  * The Earthship building design pioneered the use of tyres for earth rammed bricks: the first schematic in the 1970s Taos New Mexico by architect Michael Reynolds. Earthships have been built on every content, other than Antartica.
  * Currently, there are approximatley 3 billion people living in earthen buildings worldwide who could benefit from the structural integrity which rammed earth tyres provide.
  * In 2020 Tyre Stewardship Australia invested $100k to have rammed earth tyre walls tested by the University of South Australia, in response to the excessive stockpile of tyres avaialbe as recycled building material.

Rammed earth disadvantages: 
  - [ ] soil granularity of internal construction materials varies widely;
  - [ ] susceptable to cracking in earthquakes (if not laterally encased);
  - [ ] susceptable to erosion (if not encased and protected from environments with excess water/wind); and
  - [ ] history of rammed earth buildings being associated with ad hoc indigenous cultures makes investment by bankers/insurance institutions difficult.

Performance Solution criteria:
  - [ ] performance requirement to solve...
  - [ ] uniformity of rammed earth tyres as a consisten building material which is widely available and reproducible.
  - [ ] axial and lateral loads, e.g. side impact/collapse of tyre wall.
  - [ ] horizontal loads, e.g. external load-bearing wall compliant with ANZ/AS _________
  - [ ] expansion of load bearing external wall utilising butresses and/or lateral support for multiple storeys.

### Client brief

The buttresses on Earth#1 were used for a number of reasons (structural, health/amenity, aesthetic and accessibility)
  * The buttress feature was started by an American engineer which required them for structural integrity to lengthen and increase the overall size of the building (ISO6707-1), thereby ensuring the structural integrity of the earth/tyre wall from Earthquakes and High Wind Regions (N3+). Subsequent engineers have determined that these buttresses are not required for areas in Australia with wind and/or Earthquake area.  Nonetheless, the buttresses provide 'peace of mind' for those who might experience hurricane force winds on the coast or in alpire regions. See attached engineers report.  Most importantly, the Performancee Solution provided by the buttresse(s) enable earthen tyre walls to be expanded to the legal maximum size of a building in Australia.
  * The Buttresses were used in Earth #1 primarily to solve health and amenity issues.  For example, they are used as the basis for mounting wall framework and solid mounting for hanging doors (which could also be achieved via other framing standards). The buttresses are over-engineered with internal steel reinforced rebar, which results in an internal wall system which has structural stability for a continous wall of 3x the current length.
  * Design criteria: buttresses have become a core design feature of Earthships, alongside the bottle walls.  Buttresses, other than their ancient historical use in architecture, are also a feature of the Earth1, helping create division of space and a natural line of sight to the beautiful ceiling of Earth 1.  In short, the buttresses in Earth1 are a key aesthetic feature. 
  * Livability / accessibility: In addition to providing division between room, the concrete buttresses contrasted against the earthen adobe walls provide a perfect location for the wood heater as a thermal radiating mass.  While the exemplar energy efficiency (5 star) does not need the additional heat, it is still comforting to have a fire on the SouthCoast of Australia when Antarctic winds are blowing.
