 2. Nominated applicable _Performance Requirements_ as per the NCC (and state legislation).
 3. Agreed analytical assessment process for each agreed _Performance Requirement_ including agreed acceptance criteria, e.g. evidence of suitability, verification method, expert judgement, comparison to 'deemed to satisfy'. Testing methods could include: comparative/absolute, qualitatitive/quantitative, deterministic/probabalistic, empirical calculations, in-situ/lab testing, computer aidied modelling/simulation.
 4. Required scope of supporting evidence to achieve a _Performance Solution_.
 5. _Final report_, including: (a) overview of the PBDB (as per above), (b) 'performance requirement' analysis methods used, (c) results from analysis, (d) conclusions
 6. Acknowledgement of experts, participants and references.

## Proposal summary
History of rammed earthen wall construction for structurally habitable buildings:
  * Evidence of rammed earth wall construction for habitable building walls has been archeologically documented in: (a) Mesopotamia Fertile Crescent, 7-9th century BCE (b) Yangshao & Longshan Yellow River settlement 5th century BCE, and (c) by the 2nd cetury BCE the use of rammed earth was documented by the Chinese Imperial court as it own construction practice "夯土 Hāng tǔ" meaning "rammed earth"  Subequently, every indigenous culture with settlement based dwellings have used rammed earth to achieve structural endurance.
  * Widespread use of rammed earth to build large community settlements with multiple stories is documented in: (a) Bam Iran aka Arg-e Bam, Persian from 5th cetury BCE, (b)  Pueblo Bonito in Chaco Canyon, built by the Indigenous Ancestral Puebloans in 3rd century BCE; and (c) when the Spanish conquistadors encountered Native American settlements in the 11th century, rammed earthen dwellings were widespread with over 600 dwellings (single occupancy units) which are still standing in the Anasazi cliff top of the Four Corners area, Colorado (USA); and (d) France (based on Roman occupation and construction) widely uses "pisé walls" (from the Latin origin "pisé de terre"). First documented and used in Lyons France 1562. 
  * 1925 US Department of Agriculture published a report for homesteading farmers showing evidence that "rammed earth structures endure indefinitely and can be constructed for less than two-thirds of the cost of standard frame houses".
  * 1970s 'Earthship Biotecture' pioneered the use of tyres for earth rammed structures: the first schematic in the 1970s Taos New Mexico by architect Michael Reynolds. Earthship rammed earth walls have been built on every content, other than Antartica.
  * Currently, there are approximatley 3 billion people living in earthen buildings worldwide who could benefit from the structural integrity which rammed earth tyres provide over earthen structures which are _not_ laterally encased with steel tyre walls.
  * In 2020 Tyre Stewardship Australia invested $100k to have rammed earth tyre walls tested by the University of South Australia, in response to the excessive stockpile of tyres available as recycled building material.

Rammed earth disadvantages: 
  - [ ] soil granularity of internal construction aggregate materials varies widely;
  - [ ] susceptable to cracking in earthquakes (if not laterally encased);
  - [ ] susceptable to erosion (if not encased and protected from environments with excess water/wind); and
  - [ ] history of rammed earth buildings being associated with ad hoc indigenous cultures makes investment by bankers/insurance institutions difficult.

# Analytical assesment process and acceptance criteria
The below assessment methods are outlined in the [ABCB Structural Reliability Verification Method Handbook](www.abcb.gov.au/sites/default/files/resources/2020//Handbook_Structural_Reliability.pdf)

## Method of assesment
As per the NCC, a combination of Assessment Methods A2.2(2) will be utlised:
 - [x] NCC Vol.1 Verification Method BV1 and V2.1.1. which meet the compliance requirements for BP1.1 and BP1.2 in NCC Vol.1 and NCC Vol.2 Part 2.1.1(a)(b)(c)
 - [x] Performance Requirements (absolute) > A2.2(2)(c) expert judgement > qualitative;
 - [x] Partial supporting evidence AS.2(1)(a) Compliance with Performance Requirements (absolute) > A2.2(2)(b)(i)(ii) Verification method > Quantitative > Deterministic/Probabilistic;

## Assessment criteria
Performance solution assessment criteria (in scope):

A measure for the allowable tolerances/measurements of the dimensions of the rammed earth tyre wall in comparison to precast tilt-up concrete panels (AS3850-2003), e.g.  axial and lateral loads such as side impact/collapse of tyre wall.
  - [x] Tyre wall *robustness performance* (uncertainties in the structural modelling of the component).  A measure for the uncertainties of construction of the structural rammed earth tyre wall will be decided by the expert stakeholder panel.
  - [x] Tyre wall 'serviceability performance' (variability in the mechanical properties of the materials).  A measure for ‘quality control’ of the material manufacturing process will be agreed by the expert stakeholder panel, e.g. 
 
Deemed out of scope (for this assessment):

### Client brief

The buttresses on Earth#1 were used for a number of reasons (structural, health/amenity, aesthetic and accessibility)
  * The buttress feature was started by an American engineer which required them for structural integrity to lengthen and increase the overall size of the building (ISO6707-1), thereby ensuring the structural integrity of the earth/tyre wall from Earthquakes and High Wind Regions (N3+). Subsequent engineers have determined that these buttresses are not required for areas in Australia with wind and/or Earthquake area.  Nonetheless, the buttresses provide 'peace of mind' for those who might experience hurricane force winds on the coast or in alpire regions. See attached engineers report.  Most importantly, the Performancee Solution provided by the buttresse(s) enable earthen tyre walls to be expanded to the legal maximum size of a building in Australia.
  * The Buttresses were used in Earth #1 primarily to solve health and amenity issues.  For example, they are used as the basis for mounting wall framework and solid mounting for hanging doors (which could also be achieved via other framing standards). The buttresses are over-engineered with internal steel reinforced rebar, which results in an internal wall system which has structural stability for a continous wall of 3x the current length.
  * Design criteria: buttresses have become a core design feature of Earthships, alongside the bottle walls.  Buttresses, other than their ancient historical use in architecture, are also a feature of the Earth1, helping create division of space and a natural line of sight to the beautiful ceiling of Earth 1.  In short, the buttresses in Earth1 are a key aesthetic feature. 
  * Livability / accessibility: In addition to providing division between room, the concrete buttresses contrasted against the earthen adobe walls provide a perfect location for the wood heater as a thermal radiating mass.  While the exemplar energy efficiency (5 star) does not need the additional heat, it is still comforting to have a fire on the SouthCoast of Australia when Antarctic winds are blowing.

# Supporting evidence 
The supporting evidence for the 3x assessment criteria (structural reliability performance, robustness performance and serviceability performance) are provided below. As per the ABCB handbook on Structural Reliability Verification Methods, there are three categories which must be evaluated for structural probabilities to compare the load capacity reduction factor:

 - [x] Kf = Strength performance (variation in dimensions as a result of the fabrication/construction process.  A measure for the allowable tolerances/measurements of the dimensions of the rammed earth tyre wall in comparison to precast tilt-up concrete panels (AS3850-2003).
 - [x] Ks = Robustness performance (uncertainties in the structural modelling of the component).  A measure for the uncertainties of construction of the structural rammed earth tyre wall will be decided by the expert stakeholder panel.
 - [x] Km = Serviceability performance (variability in the mechanical properties of the materials).  A measure for ‘quality control’ of the material manufacturing process will be agreed by the expert stakeholder panel.

For each of the above, the suggested assessment acceptance criteria is:
 - [ ] Strength performance (Kf) will be evaluated via Quantitative Verification Methods as per A2.2(2)(b)(i)(ii) whereby quantitative (lateral/vertical tests) comparison to the structural dimensions of pop-up concrete walls
 - [ ] Robustness performance (Ks) will be evaluated via A2.2(2)(d) comparison with Deemed-to-Satisfy provisions
 - [ ] Serviceability performance (Km) will be evaluated via Qualitative Expert Evaluation as per A2.2(2)(c) and will require a framework for assuring construction quality build control of the laterally encased rammed earth tyres.

## Evidence for structural reliability performance
(Kf) structural engineers will compare the lateral/vertical testing done by the University of South Australia to the load tolerances for concrete and timber.

 - [x] please contact earthsteading@gmail.com for test results evaluated by the expert panel.

## Evidence for robustness performance
(Ks) robustness performance will be comparatively measured against Deemed-to-Satisfy provision for wind, snow and earthquake action over 100 years in each climate zone.

 - [x] please contact earthsteading@gmail.com for test results evaluated by the expert panel.

## Evidence for serviceability performance
The evidence for serviceability performance (Ks) will be evaluated via A2.2(2)(d) comparison with Deemed-to-Satisfy provisions, i.e. practicing builders and structural engineers will evaluate the construction process of rammed earth tyres and their probability for defective quality control manufacturing.
