## Final structural inspection
 - [ ] roof drainage connected to approved 'point of discharge'

 - [ ] stair construction, e.g. rise/run
 - [ ] glazing meet human impact, structural and weather resistance provisions
 - [ ] sanitary facilities and wet areas meet code

 - [ ] smoke detection and alarm systems are correctly placed
 - [ ] energy efficiency report requirements are complete
 - [ ] power connected including mechanical ventilation, hard wired smoke slarms, artificial lighting, etc.
 - [ ] gas cooking pipework installed
 - [ ] water supply connected
 - [ ] swimming pool and spa safety barriers
 - [ ] bushfire safety provisions, e.g. landscaping, neighboring fences/walls, etc.
 - [ ] Any additional Class 10 structures sitting alongside the main building (see below)

## Final inspection of additional Class 10 structures on site
All additional structures on the site (Class 10) must be accounted for and comply with building code and legislation, including: sheds, swimming pools, carports, pergolas, antennae/towers, signs/billboards, bushfire shelters and/or any structure costing more than $16k to build.

### Excavation, swimming pools/spas, damns/swails, site cuts, etc.
Civil infrastructure work including earthworks, road works, drainage installation, sewer, water reticulation infrastructure is subject to local planning requirements, but does not require a Building Permit as per the Domestic Building Contracts Act 1995.
 - [ ] Any structure with a water depth of more than 300mm is required to be certified:
 - [ ] If an excavation is associated with a structure and is more than 1m in height/depth, then a permit is required.
 - [ ] Registration of swimming pool/spa with local council, e.g. name, address, date of construction, applicable barrier standard (AS1926)
 - [ ] Compliant safety barriers as per most recent Certificate of Swimming Pool Barrier Compliance including future inspection dates, building permit number and alteration/modification history

### Sheds, carports, containers, timber deck, verandahs, etc
Any structure with a closed roof less than 10m2 and less than 3m in height and not constructed of masonry
 - [ ] Demonstrable load bearing capability of structure, esp any footings/foundation work
 - [ ] Is not placed forward of the primary building's frontage boundary wall;
 - [ ] Siting placement is 9 metres from frontage and 2m from side boundaries
 - [ ] If attached to another Class 10 structure (deck around the swimming pool), it must comply with that structure's requirements.

### Pergolas, sun shades/sails, netting (hail/crop), tree/cubby house, etc.
Any structure which is open roofed and/or with a permeable open weave covering, e.g. sun shade, vine lattice, vegetative shade overgrowth, platform in tree, etc.
 - [ ] less than 20m2 and less than 3.6m in height
 - [ ] sitting is further than 2.5m from boundary walls
 - [ ] built to withstand loads, e.g. wind, gravity, rain/snow/hail, earthquake etc.

### Fences/walls, antennae/masts, towers/chimnee, signs/billboards, solar panels, radio/satelite dishes etc.
Additional structures attached to the primary building do not require a permit if less than 3m above the height of the main building, however they must comply with the requirements of the structure to which the are attached:
 - [ ] Structurally sound for purpose of structure, e.g. water tower constructed to be load bearing with block/pilling, etc.
 - [ ] Any roof items requiring attachment to the roof frame must meet the load-bearing capacity and wind rating of the roof.
 - [ ] If the building is heritage, then a planning permit may be required.

## Replacement and maintenance
All building require maintenance, repair and replacement and should be added to your final schematic drawings and included in a building maintenance manual and safety measures checklist for all future owners.  Common repairs which benefit from professional guidance:
