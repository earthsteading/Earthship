# Pre-pre build

Objectives of living on land, prior to building:
 1. get to know the seasons, weather patterns, azimuths, ecosystems, flora, fauna and neighbors/community.
 2. start applying for all your permits from the local council (see list below).
 3. start improving/building your infrastructure: gravel roads, fences, bridges, etc.

The below page is intended to provide guidance to owner-builders on how to live on site throughout the build (minimum of 9 months with tradies, average ownwer-builder without trades 2-5 years).
