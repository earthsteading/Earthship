# Table of Checklist Contents


### 0. Planning application checklists
Are you as the owner-builder going to live on-site during the minimum +9months of building (avg build +2 years)?
  - [ ] [Hierarchy of needs: physiological, safety, belonging, esteem & self-actualisation](https://github.com/earthsteading/earthship/blob/master/checklist_pre-pre-build.md)
  - [ ] Owner-builder insurance and training as required by your state building authority.
  - [ ] Start recruiting tradies and volonteer builders who can help achieve your new home!  Don't forget to start buying battery powered tools if you are using volonteer builders and make sure to get insurance for everyone who comes on site.
  - [x] [construction site risk & tool training for volonteer builders](https://github.com/earthsteading/earthship/blob/master/earthship-whitecard-training.md)
  - [x] Civil works: if you are off-grid you will need to assure your civil infrastructure like roads & bridges for commercial delivery trucks and excavation of your site (for foundations, retaining walls, footings, water, effluence and landscaping) are duraable and accessible. [Earthsteading provides civil infrastructure operations services and inspection, read more via this repository](https://github.com/earthsteading/civil-infrastructure).
  - [x] Power: solar-wind-water power generation and battery storage via a plant room is essential and requires a Class 10 building permit.
  - [ ] If you are in a bushfire prone area you will need to have a Bushfire Assessment Level (BAL) report conducted so you know the fire safety standards your building will need to meet.
  - [ ] Prior to submitting your planning permit application you will need to know where your building's footpritn will reside on your property and the distances from your boundaries.  The type of building and internals of the building will be specified during your building permit phase which will include submitting your architectural plans. 

[Once you have achieved the above checklists then you are ready to have your building surveyor inspect your final architectural drawing schematics](https://github.com/earthsteading/earthship/blob/master/inspector-checklist_check-architectural-schematic.md).

### I. Build permit preparation checklists
 Preperatory staging of construction area, construction materials/systems, utility service provisions and building materials.
   - [X] Legislative land requirements, e.g. land title/deed, overlays, siting, etc.
   - [x] Site investigation and preparation, e.g. geotechnical assessment, bushfire attack level, subterranean plumbing, etc.
   - [X] Structural & supporting systems, e.g. foundation excavation, structural engineering footing plans, etc.
   - [X] Enclosing systems, e.g. walls, retaining earth berm, roof, glazing, doors, etc.
   - [X] Fire safety systems, e.g. fire alarms, wall wetting sprinklers, fire shutters, etc.
   - [X] Health and amenity systems, e.g. ventilation, light, solar mass, cooling tubes, etc.
   - [X] Safe movement and accessibility systems, e.g. mobility/accssibility compliance, univeral design, etc.
   - [X] Energy efficiency systems, e.g. solar/wind/water power generation, battery storage, etc.
   - [X] Construction process, e.g. trade sequencing and estimate costs per tradie, etc.
   - [X] List of construction materials, e.g. compliance with Australasian and ISO building standards, etc.
   - [X] Suitability/risks of system/material interactions, e.g. energy modelling
   - [X] Utility service provision, e.g. energy, water, heating, cooling, food production, sanitary, etc.
   - [X] List of required certifications, e.g. insurable construction practices, etc.
   - [X] Geographical location varations, e.g. cyclone, alpine and extreme weather risk mitigations, etc.

[*Once you have achieved the above checklists then you are ready for your building surveyor to inspect the schematics and paperwork prior to the building permit being issued*](https://github.com/earthsteading/earthship/blob/master/inspector-checklist_pre-foundation-stage.md).

### II. Building foundations and footings checklists
 Surveyor site visit 1: footprint, foundations, footings and framework (_before a footing is placed_ / after the site has been preparred, levelled, tested, etc.)
 - [ ] Setback and sitting/placement of building envelope (esp in residential areas)
 - [ ] Site drainage, concrete slab pour and building footings
 - [ ] Wall and roof framing
 - [ ] Rendering and insulation
 
### III. Building in-house utilities checklists
Surveyor site visit 2: in-house utilities water, heating/cooling, fire, etc (on completion of frame / after the building has been "topped-out" aka errected with roof, but not sealed from elements, internal sys) 
 - [ ] water collection, storage, pressure, filtration, grey water recycling, black water recylcing (septic/sewage) and permaculture zones (sand/swail pits), etc.
 - [ ] heating: atrium, fire, solar water heater, etc
 - [ ] Cooling: convection atrium, cooling tubes, home automation acuators, etc.
 - [ ] Solar/wind power generation: lighting (solar tubes), appliances (fridge/kettle, tv/comp), etc.
 - [ ] Energy storage: batteries (lithium/ion, lead/acid, etc)
 - [ ] Atrium (food/medicine production) 

### IV. Building enclosures checklists
 Surveyor site visit 3: sealing/securing building with windows, doors, insultation, etc (on completion of all building works) after the building has it's in-house utilities installed)
 - [ ] stem/atrium wall framing and carpentry
 - [ ] wall finishing: earthen, timber and concrete
 - [ ] glazing: windows, ventilation, etc.
 - [ ] roof insulation
 
 ### V. Building fixings & features checklists
 Surveyor site visit 4: fixing, features, amenities, etc. (after the building has beed securely sealed with lock and key)

 Once you have achieved the above checklists you are ready for your final inspection by the building surveyor:
