# Off-grid (earthship-like) sustainable homes for Australasians

*Aim of this building code repository: provide systematic documentation for owner-builders which empowers them to build an insurable off-grid residential buildings for the Australian environment.*

Objectives:
 - [x] provide easy to use ikea-like checklists which owner-builder partners can use to build their home
 - [x] increase ease/efficiency in building an off-grid home which meets all the required building code legislation
 - [x] lower the cost of building a home which is both luxourious and sustainable
 - [ ] (*Earthsteading mission*) to transcend humanities understanding of residential homes as buildings which are able to capture carbon -as well as- improve the living (indigenous/biological symbiotic/mutualistic) environment around the home.

## Standards:
 * This code repository utilise the [National Construction Code](https://ncc.abcb.gov.au/) for all building definitions.  Any specialist definitions are listed in [terminology & definitions](https://github.com/earthsteading/earthship/blob/master/terminology.md)
 * Your building surveyor can provide state based legislative details, which are outlined in the [state legislation exceptions checklist](https://github.com/earthsteading/earthship/blob/master/checklist_state-legislation-exceptions.md)
 * Generic building designs for a "Biotecture Earthships (TM)" from the USA can be purchased via the [Earthship App on Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=hr.apps.n207007048) <-- however, please be aware these designs are not suitable for council approved buildings in Australia.  If you would like to adapt an Earthship design please contact [Dr Martin Freney (South Australia) for purchasing his certified design services](https://www.earthshipecohomes.com.au/contact.html)
 * Disclaimer: this building code repository was created by [@Earthsteading Building Surveying and Civic Construction]() as part of coursework for the Advanced Diploma in Building Surveying at Federation University (2020). Hire a building surveyor with indemnity insurance, or _use these instructions at your own risk_.
 * Suggest a change: please submit a [bug/issue request](https://github.com/earthsteading/earthship/issues), and/or submit a 'pull request' for state-specific (legislative/environmental) changes.
 * Hire a specialist off-grid building surveyor <earthsteading@gmail.com> (initial consult free, hire cost: 1% of entire build, e.g. for a $350K build, a building surveyor will accompany you throughout your journey for ~$3500).

## Actors:

The minimum viable set of people you will require to build an off-grid home in Australia
 - [x] owner-builder = you (see [terminology for definitions](https://github.com/earthsteading/earthship/blob/master/terminology.md))
 - [x] surveyor = your local guide/friend and person responsible for empowering you to meet all the legislative requirements: federal, state and council.
 - [x] inspector/certifier = the local government council representative who will hold you and your surveyor accountable for health and safety.
 - [x] certified tradies = chippies (carpenter), sparkies (electrcian), plumbers and earthworks (civic construction).
 - [x] certified engineer = to sign off on any architectural plans you are using.

## Methodology
How to use this repository of building code checklists:
  - [x] The overall guiding principles of the following checklists is a book called "The Checklist Manifesto" <-- read it!
  - [x] The use of Git(hub) as versioning repository is so that multiple people can help amend and improve these checklists for Australasia-wide use, e.g. please contribute additional checklists for other states/regionsvia a "pull request".
  - [x] The architectural examples for each checklist have been used to build council approved off-grid buildings in Victoria, Western Australian and South Australia (consult a building surveyor licensed in your State as _building code legislation changes in each state_).
  - [ ] If you are a building surveyor looking to improve these checklists for NSW, FNQ, ACT, NT, Tasmania and/or Torres Straight Islands, please get in touch = earthsteading@gmail.com

# Stages of build 
Your building surveyor will provide consultation/documentation prior to each stage of your build:
  - [ ] land purchased and surveyed
  - [x] foundations and footings
  - [x] in-house utilities
  - [x] enclosure of building
  - [x] fixings and features
  - [ ] occupancy certificate!
