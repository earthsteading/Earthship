# Off-grid (earthship-like) homes for Australians

*Aim of this repository: provide systematic inspector-ready documentation for owner-builders which enables/empowers them to build an insurable off-grid residential buildings for the Australian (firezone) environment.*

 * "inspector-ready documentation" = the build plans, documents and certifications you are required to prepare with your supporting building surveyor for submission to the government's council approved building inspector (certifier).
 * "insurable" = hire a building surveyor to assure that your build is not delayed by your council/government inspector, and/or rejected for habitation, aka your surveyor will enable your building to pass building code so it can have insurance coverage.
 * "firezone" = Australia has more fires than any other continent on earth and they are increasing, either design your building to be firezone ready (BAL-FZ) or make sure your insurance is fire-proof (NB most insurance is prohibitively expensive for re-building the original building).
 * "owner-builder" = the person(s) building the propoerty: a.) own the land, b.) are insured to build, and c.) intend to inhabit a fully certified and insurable building according to Australia federal and state legislation. These buildings are legal inheretable legacies.
 * "off-grid" = a building which is responsible for providing it own utilities, including: a.) safe shelter, b.) water management, c.) heating systems, d.) sewage systems, e.) energy systems, f.) [optional] food production systems.
 * "residential building" = class 1a buildings single story as defined by the National Construction Code of Australia.
 * "'green'+'sustainability'" = reduction & reeducation in utility cost efficiencies, esp for quantifiable envrionmental value.
 * For all building terminology used in this repository please utilise the Australian national dictionary of building and construction codes: https://www.constructiondictionary.com.au/ <-- each term you lookup will have an associated *standard* which will reference the performance requirements for each part of your build.

*Mission*: to transcend residential family homes into buildings which are not only carbon neutral, but able to capture carbon as well as improve the living indigenous (symbiotic/mutualistic) environment around the home.

## Standards:

 * For building requirements please utilise the National Construction Code (being mindful of both Federal and State requirements for building: https://ncc.abcb.gov.au/ (please always consult a building surveyor prior to beginning a build)
   * Your building surveyor can provide state based legislative details, for example this project is based on Victoria state building codes, see: https://www.vba.vic.gov.au/
 * Generic building designs for a "Biotecture Earthships (TM)" from the USA can be purchased via the Earthship App on Android: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=hr.apps.n207007048 <-- however, please be aware these designs are not suitable for council approved buildings in Australia.  If you would like to adapt an Earthship design please contact Dr Martin Freney (South Australia) for purchasing his draughtsman and engineering services: https://www.earthshipecohomes.com.au/contact.html
 * Disclaimer: this building code repository was created by @Earthsteading Building Surveying and Civic Construction as part of coursework for the Advanced Diploma in Building Surveying at Federation University.
 * Suggest a chage: please submit a pull request and/or bug request for any proposed amendments.
 * Hire a specialist off-grid building surveyor earthsteading@gmail.com (initial consult free, hire cost: 1% of entire build, e.g. for a $350K build, a building surveyor will accompany you throughout your journey for $3500).

## Actors:

The minimum viable set of people you will require to build an off-grid home in Australia
 - [ ] owner-builder = you (see definition above)
 - [ ] surveyor = your local guide/friend and person responsible for empowering you to meet all the legislative requirements: federal, state and council.
 - [ ] inspector = the local government council representative who will hold you and your surveyor accountable for all appropriate documentation and certificates.  The inspector will declare if your building is inhabitalbe, ergo legal, ergo insurable, ergo inheretable.
 - [ ] certified tradies = chippies (carpenter), sparkies (electrcian), plumbers and earthworks.
 - [ ] certified engineer = to sign off on any architectural plans you are using.

## Methodology (how to use this repository of building code checklists):

 * The overall guiding principles of the following checklists is a book called "The Checklist Manifesto" <-- read it!
 * The use of Git(hub) as versioning repository is so that multiple people can help amend and improve these checklists for Australia wide commons use, e.g. please contribute additional checklists for other states and environmental conditions found throughout the continent of Australia.
 * The architectural design provided as examples for each checklist have been used to build council approved buildings in Victoria, Western Australian and South Australia (consult a building surveyor licensed in your State as _building code legislation changes_). Please submit meaningful bugs, and pull requests to add/amend our shared checklists.  

  * Below is a timeline (Gaant) chart showing the different stages of this build, each stage of the build provides a new page outling architectural details and the required accompanying standards, certifications and documentations.
 * For the purposes of this repository the Victorian Building Association (VBA) and Western Australia ?__________? is the regulator which have been used per example.

# Stages of build (your building surveyor will provide consultation/documentation prior to each stage of your build):

  * 0.) Pre-pre-build (aka how you as owner-builder are going to live on-site during the minimum +9months of building (avg build +2 years).

 I. [Build_Preparation Checklists](../earthship/build-preparation.md): analysis of construction area, construction materials/systems, utility service provisions and example building materials.

   - [X] Structural & supporting systems
   - [X] Enclosing systems
   - [X] Fire safety
   - [X] Health and amenity

   - [X] List of required certifications

 II. Surveyor site visit 1: footprint, foundations, footings and framework (_before a footing is placed_ / after the site has been preparred, levelled, tested, etc.)
  * before an in situ reinforced concrete member nominated by the relevant building surveyor is poured, e.g. concrete buttress, assembled concrete members, etc.
 
 III. Surveyor site visit 2: in-house utilities water, heating/cooling, fire, etc (on completion of frame / after the building has been "topped-out" aka errected with roof, but not sealed from elements, internal walls exposed) 
   * To be continued...

 IV. Surveyor site visit 3: sealing/securing building with windows, doors, insultation, etc (on completion of all building works) after the building has it's in-house utilities installed)
   * To be continued...

 V. Surveyor site visit 4: fixing, features, color, etc. (after the building has beed securely sealed with lock and key)
   * To be continued...
