# Off-grid (earthship-like) sustainable homes for Australasians

*Aim of this building code repository: provide systematic documentation for owner-builders which empowers them to build an insurable off-grid residential buildings for the Australian environment.*

Objectives:
 - [x] provide easy to use ikea-like checklists which owner-builder partners can use to build their home
 - [x] increase ease/efficiency in building an off-grid home which meets all the required building code legislation
 - [x] lower the cost of building a home which is both luxourious and sustainable
 - [ ] (*Earthsteading mission*) to transcend humanities understanding of residential homes as buildings which are able to capture carbon -as well as- improve the living (indigenous/biological symbiotic/mutualistic) environment around the home.

## Standards:
 * This code repository utilise the [National Construction Code](https://ncc.abcb.gov.au/) for all building definitions.  Any specialist definitions are listed in [terminology & definitions](https://github.com/earthsteading/earthship/blob/master/terminology.md)
 * Your building surveyor can provide state based legislative details, which are outlined in the [state legislation exceptions checklist](https://github.com/earthsteading/earthship/blob/master/checklist_state-legislation-exceptions.md)
 * Generic building designs for a "Biotecture Earthships (TM)" from the USA can be purchased via the [Earthship App on Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=hr.apps.n207007048) <-- however, please be aware these designs are not suitable for council approved buildings in Australia.  If you would like to adapt an Earthship design please contact [Dr Martin Freney (South Australia) for purchasing his certified design services](https://www.earthshipecohomes.com.au/contact.html)
 * Disclaimer: this building code repository was created by [@Earthsteading Building Surveying and Civic Construction]() as part of coursework for the Advanced Diploma in Building Surveying at Federation University (2020). Hire a building surveyor with indemnity insurance, or _use these instructions at your own risk_.
 * Suggest a change: please submit a [bug/issue request](https://github.com/earthsteading/earthship/issues), and/or submit a 'pull request' for state-specific (legislative/environmental) changes.
 * Hire a specialist off-grid building surveyor (approximate cost: 1% of entire insurable build, e.g. for a $350K build, a building surveyor will accompany you throughout your journey from building permit to occupancy certificate for ~$3500).

## Actors:

The minimum viable set of people you will require to build an off-grid home in Australia
 - [x] owner-builder = you (see [terminology for definitions](https://github.com/earthsteading/earthship/blob/master/terminology.md))
 - [x] surveyor = your local guide/friend and person responsible for empowering you to meet all the legislative requirements: federal, state and council.
 - [x] inspector/certifier = the local government council representative who will hold you and your surveyor accountable for health and safety.
 - [x] certified tradies = chippies (carpenter), sparkies (electrcian), plumbers and earthworks (civic construction).
 - [x] certified engineer = to sign off on any architectural plans you are using.
 - [ ] [optional see state legislation] building designer or architect for providing drawings for submission to council inspector for certification.

## Methodology
How to use this repository of building code checklists:
  - [x] The overall guiding principles of the following checklists is a book called "The Checklist Manifesto" <-- read it!
  - [x] The use of open source repository is so the wider community can help amend and improve these checklists for Australasia-wide use, e.g. please contribute additional checklists for other states/regions via a "pull request", see open source licensing on each page.
  - [x] The architectural examples for each checklist have been used to build council approved off-grid buildings in Victoria, Western Australian and South Australia (consult a building surveyor licensed in your State as _building code legislation changes in each state_).
  - [ ] If you are a building surveyor looking to improve these checklists for NSW, FNQ, ACT, NT, Tasmania and/or Torres Straight Islands, please get in touch = earthsteading@gmail.com

# Stages of build 
Your building surveyor will provide consultation/documentation prior to each stage of your build:
  - [x] land purchased and surveyed
  - [x] building permit
  - [x] foundations and footings
  - [x] in-house utilities
  - [x] enclosure of building
  - [x] fixings and features
  - [x] occupancy certificate!

### 0. Pre-pre-build checklists 
Are you as the owner-builder going to live on-site during the minimum +9months of building (avg build +2 years)?
  - [ ] [Hierarchy of needs: physiological, safety, belonging, esteem & self-actualisation](https://github.com/earthsteading/earthship/blob/master/checklist_pre-pre-build.md)
  - [ ] start finding tradies and volonteer builders who can help achieve your build!  Don't forget to start buying tools if you are using volonteer builders.
  - [x] [construction site risk & tool training for volonteer builders](https://github.com/earthsteading/earthship/blob/master/earthship-whitecard-training.md)
  - [x] Civil works: if you are off-grid you will need to assure your civil infrastructure like roads & bridges for commercial delivery trucks and excavation of your site (for foundations, retaining walls, footings, water, effluence and landscaping) are ready to go.  [Earthsteading provides civil infrastructure operations services and inspection, read more via this repository](https://github.com/earthsteading/civil-infrastructure).

[Once you have achieved the above checklists then you are ready to have your building surveyor inspect your final architectural drawing schematics](https://github.com/earthsteading/earthship/blob/master/inspector-checklist_check-architectural-schematic.md).

### I. Build preparation checklists
 Preperatory staging of construction area, construction materials/systems, utility service provisions and building materials.
   - [X] Site investigation and preparation
   - [X] Structural & supporting systems
   - [X] Enclosing systems
   - [X] Fire safety systems
   - [X] Health and amenity systems
   - [X] Safe movement and accessibility systems
   - [X] Energy efficiency systems
   - [X] Construction process, trade sequencing and estimate costs
   - [X] List of construction materials
   - [X] Suitability/risks of system/material interactions
   - [X] Utility service provision
   - [X] List of required certifications
   - [X] Geographical location varations

[Once you have achieved the above checklists then you are ready for your building surveyor to inspect the schematics and paperwork prior to the building permit being issued](https://github.com/earthsteading/earthship/blob/master/inspector-checklist_pre-foundation-stage.md).

### II. Building foundations and footings checklists
 Surveyor site visit 1: footprint, foundations, footings and framework (_before a footing is placed_ / after the site has been preparred, levelled, tested, etc.)

 - [ ] Site drainage, concrete slab pour and building footings
 - [ ] Wall and roof framing
 - [ ] Rendering and insulation
 
### III. Building in-house utilities checklists
Surveyor site visit 2: in-house utilities water, heating/cooling, fire, etc (on completion of frame / after the building has been "topped-out" aka errected with roof, but not sealed from elements, internal sys) 
 - [ ] water collection, storage, pressure, filtration, grey water recycling, black water recylcing (septic/sewage) and permaculture zones (sand/swail pits), etc.
 - [ ] heating: atrium, fire, solar water heater, etc
 - [ ] Cooling: convection atrium, cooling tubes, home automation acuators, etc.
 - [ ] Solar/wind power generation: lighting (solar tubes), appliances (fridge/kettle, tv/comp), etc.
 - [ ] Energy storage: batteries (lithium/ion, lead/acid, etc)

### IV. Building enclosures checklists
 Surveyor site visit 3: sealing/securing building with windows, doors, insultation, etc (on completion of all building works) after the building has it's in-house utilities installed)
