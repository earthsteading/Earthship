# Off-grid (earthship-like) homes for Australians

Aim of this repository: provide systematic inspector-ready documentaiton for owner-builders to enable them to build an insurable off-grid residential buildings for the Australian (firezone) environment.

## Terminology and Standards:

 * "inspector-ready documentation" = the build plans, documents and certifications you are required to prepare with your supporting building surveyor for submission to the government's council approved building inspector.
 * "insurable" = hire a building surveyor to assure that your build is not delayed by your council/government inspector, and/or rejected for habitation, aka your surveyor will enable your building to pass building code so it can have insurance coverage.
 * "firezone" = Australia has more fires than any other continent on earth and they are increasing, either design your building to be firezone ready (BAL-FZ) or make sure your insurance is fire-proof (NB most insurance is prohibitively expensive for re-building the original building).
 * "owner-builder" = the person(s) building the propoerty: a.) own the land, b.) are insured to build, and c.) intend to inhabit a fully certified and insurable building according to Australia federal and state legislation. These buildings are legal inheretable legacies.
 * "off-grid" = a building which is responsible for providing it own utilities, including: a.) safe shelter, b.) water management, c.) heating systems, d.) sewage systems, e.) energy systems, f.) [optional] food production systems.
 * "residential building" = class 1a buildings single story as defined by the National Construction Code of Australia.
 * For all building terminology used in this repository please utilise the Australian national dictionary of building and construction codes: https://www.constructiondictionary.com.au/ <-- each term you lookup will have an associated *standard* which will reference the performance requirements for each part of your build.
 * For building requirements please utilise the National Construction Code (being mindful of both Federal and State requirements for building: https://ncc.abcb.gov.au/ (please always consult a building surveyor prior to beginning a build)
   * Your building surveyor can provide state based legislative details, for example this project is based on Victoria state building codes, see: https://www.vba.vic.gov.au/
 * Generic building designs for a "Biotecture Earthships (TM)" from the USA can be purchased via the Earthship App on Android: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=hr.apps.n207007048 <-- however, please be aware these designs are not suitable for council approved buildings in Australia.  If you would like to adapt an Earthship design please contact Dr Martin Freney (South Australia) for purchasing his draughtsman and engineering services: https://www.earthshipecohomes.com.au/contact.html
 * Disclaimer: this building code repository was created by @Earthsteading Building Surveying and Civic Construction as part of coursework for the Advanced Diploma in Building Surveying at Federation University.
 * Suggest a chage: please submit a pull request and/or bug request for any proposed amendments.
 * Hire a specialist off-grid building surveyor earthsteading@gmail.com (initial consult free, hire cost: 1% of entire build, e.g. for a $350K build, a building surveyor will accompany you throughout your journey for $3500).

## Methodology (how to use this building code repository):

 * Below is a timeline (Gaant) chart showing the different stages of this build, each stage of the build provides a new page outling architectural details and the required accompanying standards, certifications and documentations.
 * The architectural design provided have been used to build council approved buildings in Victoria, Western Australian and South Australia (consult a building surveyor licensed in your State).  
 * For the purposes of this repository the Victorian Building Association (VBA) is the regulator which have been used per example.

# Stages of build (your building surveyor will provide consultation/documentation prior to each stage of your build):

  * 0.) Pre-build (aka how you as owner-builder are going to live on-site during the minimum +9months of building (avg build +2 years).

 i. [Build_Preparation](../earthship/preparation.md): analysis of construction area, construction materials/systems, utility service provisions and example building materials.
   * Site investigation and preparation, including: drainage, earthworks, pest risk management, soil identification/assessment, foundations and footings.
   * Construction methods for structural and supporting systems, including: masonry (earthwall construction, (un)reinforced masonry, weatherproofing, etc.) and 
   * Structural & supporting systems: a.) masonry (earthwall, concrete, weatherproofing), Other systems (floors, roofs, ventilation, walls, framing, cyclone, timber, etc.).
   * Enclosing systems (glazing, gutters, downpipes, roof cladding, wall cladding, etc.).
   * Fire safety (clearance/protection of heating appliances, fire separation/containment, bushfire level and plan, smoke alarms, etc).
   * Health and amenity (facilities, lights, room height, sound insulation, ventilation, wet areas, etc).
   * Safe movement and access: accessibility (doors, pathways, ramps, ingress/egress, etc) and movement (balustrades, stair construction, slippage, swimming pool access, etc.)
   * Energy efficiency (air movement, building fabric, building sealing and insulation, external glazing, services, etc)
   * Construction process, trade sequencing and costs.
   * Geographical location (climate, sun, wind, etc)
   * List of construction materials (adhesives and sealants, admixtures, clay products, concrete products, glass, masonry, metal, mortar for load bearing walls, new materials, plaster and plasterboard, plastic, pre-stressed concrete, fire-rated protective coating, timber products, water-proofing, etc.)
   * Suitability/risks of construction materials in relation to one another and system interaction.
   * Utility service provision analysis (energy supply infrastructure, heating / cooling systems, fire protection systems, gas and hydraulic systems, etc.)
   * List of Australian building suppliers/tradies with standard based (ANSI, performance, deemed to satisfy) certification.

 ii. Surveyor site visit 1: footprint, foundations, footings and framework (after the site has been preparred, levelled, etc)
  * To be continued...
 
 iii. Surveyor site visit 2: in-house utilities water, heating/cooling, fire, etc (after the building has been "topped-out" aka errected with roof, but not sealed from elements) 
   * To be continued...

 iv. Surveyor site visit 3: sealing/securing building with windows, doors, insultation, etc (after the building has it's in-house utilities installed)
   * To be continued...

 v. Surveyor site visit 4: fixing, features, etc. (after the building has beed securely sealed with lock and key)
   * To be continued...
