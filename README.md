# Off-grid (earthship-like) homes for Australians

Aim of this repository: provide systematic inspection documentaiton for owner-builders to enable them to build an insurable off-grid residential buildings for the Australian (firezone) environment.

Terminology and Standards:

 * "inspection documentation" = the build plans, documents and certifications you are required to prepare with your supporting building surveyor for submission to the government's council approved building inspector.
 * "insurable" = hire a building surveyor to insure that your build is not delayed by your council/government inspector, and/or rejected for habitation, aka your surveyor will enable your building to have insurance coverage.
 * "firezone" = Australia has more fires than any other continent on earth and they are increasing, either design your building to be firezone ready (BAL-FZ) or make sure your insurance is fire-proof (NB most insurance will not cover the full cost of a new building).
 * "owner-builder" = the person(s) building the propoerty: own the land and intend to inhabit a fully certified and insurable building according to Australia federal and state legislation. 
 * "Off-grid" = a building which is responsible for providing it own utilities, including: a.) safe shelter, b.) water management, c.) heating systems, d.) sewage systems, e.) energy systems, f.) [optional] food production systems.
 * "residential building" = class 1a buildings single story as defined by the National Construction Code of Australia.
 * For all building terminology used in this repository please utilise the Australian national dictionary of building and construction codes: https://www.constructiondictionary.com.au/ <-- each term you lookup will have an associated *standard* which will reference the performance requirements for each part of your build.
 * For building requirements please utilise the National Construction Code (being mindful of both Federal and State requirements for building: https://ncc.abcb.gov.au/ (please always consult a building surveyor prior to beginning a build)
   * Your building surveyor can provide state based legislative details, for example this project is based on Victoria state building codes, see: https://www.vba.vic.gov.au/
 * Generic duilding designs for a "Biotecture Earthships (TM)" in the USA can be purchased via the Earthship App on Android: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=hr.apps.n207007048 <-- however, please be aware these designs are not suitable for council approved submission in Australia.  If you would like to adapt an Earthship design please contact Dr Martin Freney (South Australia) for purchasing his draughtsman and engineering services: https://www.earthshipecohomes.com.au/contact.html

Methodology (how to use this building code repository):

 * Below is a Gaant chart showing the different stages of this build.
 * The architectural design provided have been used to build council approved buildings in Victoria, Western Australian and South Australia (consult a building surveyor licensed in your state).  
 * For the purposes of this repository the Victorian Building Association (VBA) is the regulations which have been used.
