# Off-grid (earthship-like) sustainable homes for Australasians

*Aim of this building code repository: provide systematic inspector-ready documentation for owner-builders which enables/empowers them to build an insurable off-grid residential buildings for the Australian environment.*

*Earthsteading Mission*: to transcend residential homes into buildings which are not only carbon neutral, but able to capture carbon as well as improve the living indigenous (symbiotic/mutualistic) environment around the home.

[terminology & definitions](https://github.com/earthsteading/earthship/blob/5f4f96040fc8ca2ebc30613c183d4a93b0921481/terminology.md)

## Standards:

 * For building requirements please utilise the National Construction Code (being mindful of both Federal and State requirements for building: https://ncc.abcb.gov.au/ (please always consult a building surveyor prior to beginning a build)
   * Your building surveyor can provide state based legislative details, for example this project is based on Victoria state building codes, see: https://www.vba.vic.gov.au/
 * Generic building designs for a "Biotecture Earthships (TM)" from the USA can be purchased via the Earthship App on Android: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=hr.apps.n207007048 <-- however, please be aware these designs are not suitable for council approved buildings in Australia.  If you would like to adapt an Earthship design please contact Dr Martin Freney (South Australia) for purchasing his draughtsman and engineering services: https://www.earthshipecohomes.com.au/contact.html
 * Disclaimer: this building code repository was created by @Earthsteading Building Surveying and Civic Construction as part of coursework for the Advanced Diploma in Building Surveying at Federation University.
 * Suggest a chage: please submit a pull request and/or bug request for any proposed amendments.
 * Hire a specialist off-grid building surveyor earthsteading@gmail.com (initial consult free, hire cost: 1% of entire build, e.g. for a $350K build, a building surveyor will accompany you throughout your journey for $3500).

## Actors:

The minimum viable set of people you will require to build an off-grid home in Australia
 - [x] owner-builder = you (see definition above)
 - [x] surveyor = your local guide/friend and person responsible for empowering you to meet all the legislative requirements: federal, state and council.
 - [x] inspector/certifier = the local government council representative who will hold you and your surveyor accountable for health and safety.
 - [x] certified tradies = chippies (carpenter), sparkies (electrcian), plumbers and earthworks (civic construction).
 - [x] certified engineer = to sign off on any architectural plans you are using.

## Methodology (how to use this repository of building code checklists):

 * The overall guiding principles of the following checklists is a book called "The Checklist Manifesto" <-- read it!
 * The use of Git(hub) as versioning repository is so that multiple people can help amend and improve these checklists for Australia wide commons use, e.g. please contribute additional checklists for other states and environmental conditions found throughout the continent of Australia.
 * The architectural design provided as examples for each checklist have been used to build council approved buildings in Victoria, Western Australian and South Australia (consult a building surveyor licensed in your State as _building code legislation changes_). Please submit meaningful bugs, and pull requests to add/amend our shared checklists. 
 * For the purposes of this repository the Victorian Building Association (VBA) and Western Australia ?__________? is the regulator which have been used per example.

# Stages of build 
Your building surveyor will provide consultation/documentation prior to each stage of your build.

 ### II. [Foundations and footings checklists]():
 Surveyor site visit 1: footprint, foundations, footings and framework (_before a footing is placed_ / after the site has been preparred, levelled, tested, etc.)
  * before an in situ reinforced concrete member nominated by the relevant building surveyor is poured, e.g. concrete buttress, assembled concrete members, etc.
 - [X]
 - 
 
### III. [In-house utilities checklists]()
 Surveyor site visit 2: in-house utilities water, heating/cooling, fire, etc (on completion of frame / after the building has been "topped-out" aka errected with roof, but not sealed from elements, internal sys) 
   * To be continued...
 - [X]

 ### IV. [Enclosure checklists]()
 Surveyor site visit 3: sealing/securing building with windows, doors, insultation, etc (on completion of all building works) after the building has it's in-house utilities installed)
   * To be continued...
 - [X]
 
 ### V. [Fixings & features checklists]()
 Surveyor site visit 4: fixing, features, color, etc. (after the building has beed securely sealed with lock and key)
