### Performance Based Design Brief for Energy Efficiency of Passive Solar buildings via thermal solar atrium and cooling tubes:
  * The most practical solution for achieving a buildings energy effciency is it's positiong to collect the naturally occuring thermal heat of the sun.  While most buildings designs consider the position of the sun (azimuth) in relation to its sitting, it is the aplification and storage of the sun's warmth which can easily "power" the homeostasis of a home throughout winter.  The primary feature of an Earthship, is the positioning of the atrium glazed wall to magnify the solar rays via the atrium unto thermal walls which can store heat and slowly dissapate the heat over the course of the day.
