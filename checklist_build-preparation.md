# Inspector level documentation checklist (see below for owner-builder checklists and diagrams):
- [ ] drainage = water recycling management systems.
- [ ] soil assessment = suitability of soil types for foundations, earthworks, soaks and other earth infrastructures.
- [ ] earthworks = foundation, retaining walls and water topography.
- [ ] footing = stability of building long term, e.g. fires, earthquakes and other natural disasters. 
- [ ] pest risk management = termites and other pets who will want to cohabitate with you.

Detailed examples of the above requirements below:

## Drainage (functional design of integrated water recycling modules):

The design of the "water management system" in an off-grid residential building should be divided into 4x constuction modules for inspection (see NCC Vol.3).  Depending on the Australian state you live in the permitable use will be dependent on local legislation, please consult your local certified surveyor.  You will require a plumbers certificate of your plumbing work, so please engage a plumber early-on to inform them of your build plans (note: most plumbers love off-grid). In terms of the Australian National Construction Code (NCC) the water systems you will be installing include: 

 - [ ] 
 - [ ] Absorption trench = Also called: absorption trench, absorption well, soakaway, soakpit.  Define: a pit, trench or well dug into permeable ground, filled with broken stone, bricks or large granular material and usually covered with earth, where liquid may soak away into the ground. Also called soakaway (AS/NZS 3500.0:2003)
 - [ ] Septic tank
 - [ ] Sand pit 
 - [ ] Transpiration bed

For the water recylcing techniques to approved by your inspector, you should begin by pretending you are a droplet of rain falling on your roof.  That droplet of water will take the following 'approved' journey:

- [ ] proposed drainage lines, including: pipe sizes, pumps, gradients & levels (#! obtain engineer spec and plumber certificate)
      * PVC pipe = 100mm diameter in geofabric sock (AS 2002: Earth-retaining structures)
      * gradient = 1:100 fall
      * height levels for: (a) roof max/min/slope =[?] (b) roof drainage height(s) =[] (c) stormwater pit level =[] (d) rainwater tank (main) = [ ] (e) electric pump to header tank =[ ]
        * 
        * rainwater harvesting system (NCC) = 
- [ ] Discharge points
- [ ] Pits, sumps & draingae pits
- [ ] Wells and trenches
- [ ] Tanks (above and below ground level)
- [ ] Detention and un-detained areas, and detention system employed
- [ ] Pumps
- [ ] Pervious and impervious area identification
      * vapour barriers 
- [ ] Existing site and adjacent road levels
- [ ] Existing and proposed floor levels
- [ ] Existing site and proposed levels
- [ ] Direction flow
- [ ] Pollutant control devices

## Stormwater drainage requirements:
- [ ] Post development surface runoff from the design must not exceed pre-development run off from the site from a prescribed year ARI storm.
- [ ] No run-off shall be directed from the development site to adjacent properties.
- [ ] Floor levels, site works and drainage system shall be designed to provide 100 â€“ year ARI protection against inundation of buildings and any flood intolerant surfaces.
- [ ] Measures shall be incorporated within the site works along property boundaries to contain gutter flows.
- [ ] Measures shall be incorporated in all developments to ensure no stormwater borne pollutants (including litter, silt and any harmful substances) are discharged into any drainage system.
- [ ] Soakage systems shall be safely located, shall provide detention/retention and shall be environmentally appropriate.
- [ ] When a pump system is installed, the pump system failure must not result in inundation of any building or adjacent property, measures shall be incorporated to minimise the risk of failure during a storm.
- [ ] All drainage infrastructures within the development site shall be maintained, serviced, cleaned and sustained operational to the design requirements by the owner/management.
