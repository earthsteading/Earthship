If you are going to have volonteers on your build site it is imporant that you have *each* volonteer provide the following evidence prior to stepping onto your build site:

 - [x] As the owner-builder you will need to insure yourself and any other volonteer builder who are on site, please consult your local [state based building association for a list of insurance providers](https://www.vba.vic.gov.au/owner-builders/being-an-owner-builder).
 - [x] Have each volonteer read over the following list of potential hazards which they are likely to encounter on a build site, make sure they provide an email/sms message to you acknolwedging that they are aware of ALL hazards and have reviewed the precaustions which WorkSafe Australia recommend. [OH&S list of likely incidents to occur during an off-grid build, and skills which volonteer builders should be ready to perform safely prior to participating on a build site](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQllBrW6W1KF1Q-_xXCRZcEh1_HvkWFIrlSTyDvHaMA_oiyhaTXds_qrxP4HIQb0OBcUuAL43-epCZ6/pubhtml). 
 - [x] Each volonteer builder should take one of the "white card" construction site safety trainings courses, which are often provided free by industry organisations like (Civil Construction Victoria)[https://www.ccfvic.com.au/training-courses/].
 - [ ] Please note, if you are allowing volonteer builders to camp on site, you will require additional insurance coverage.
