# legislative requirements for placement of building (esp in a residential area)

Standards / legislation applicable to the below checklists:
  * See list of [state-based legislation and environmental exceptions](https://github.com/earthsteading/earthship/blob/master/checklist_state-legislation-exceptions.md)
  * AS/NZS 4200.1:2017: Pliable building membranes and underlays
  * Performance measure: "vapour permeance/diffusance" = water vapour flow per unit area, e.g. microgram per pascal square metre second (µg/Pa.m2.s); microgram per newton second (µg/N.s).

## Setback requirements checklist
Below is a generalised list which your state based legislation will require:

  - [ ] once a building envelope is laid out on site (i.e. staked marker, trench for cornerstones, etc), check plans to confirm the building envelope is placed legally 
  - [ ] acquire from council a list of "exisiting buildings" which have registered "occupancy certificates"
  - [ ] maximum allowed height of building from 'original foundation', vs 'excavated earthwork foundation' 
  - [ ] maximum/minimum allowed setback of building envelope from property boundary
  - [ ] minimum parking, garden and permeance spaces (i.e. amount of water shed/soaked) 
  - [ ] additional allowed space for unroofed pools, spas, terraces, decks, ramps, pergolas. water/fuel tanks, heating/cooling equipment and/or below ground structures
  - [ ] [optional] estimate additional extensions of building via verandas, pagodas, porches, gutters, eaves and fascia.
