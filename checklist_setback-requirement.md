# legislative requirements for placement of building (esp in a residential area)

Standards / legislation applicable to the below checklists:
  * See list of [state-based legislation and environmental exceptions](https://github.com/earthsteading/earthship/blob/master/checklist_state-legislation-exceptions.md)
  * AS/NZS 4200.1:2017: Pliable building membranes and underlays
  * Re "daylight size" = AS 1288-2006: Selection and installation / https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daylight_factor 
  * Performance measure: "vapour permeance/diffusance" = water vapour flow per unit area, e.g. microgram per pascal square metre second (µg/Pa.m2.s); microgram per newton second (µg/N.s).

## Setback requirements checklist
Below is a generalised list which your state based legislation will require:

  - [ ] once the building envelope is laid out on site (i.e. staked marker, trench for cornerstones, etc), confirm building envelope is geospatially and legally (cadastral) placed
  - [ ] placement of boundary markers (fence, wall, etc) matching council cadastral land survey/map.
  - [ ] acquire from council a list of "exisiting buildings" in proximity which have registered "occupancy certificates"
  - [ ] maximum allowed height of building from 'original foundation', vs 'excavated earthwork foundation' 
  - [ ] maximum/minimum allowed setback of building envelope from property boundaries and access routes (frontage street, rear & side overlooking property lines)
  - [ ] maximum height on boundary line for fences, walls and party walls, etc.
  - [ ] minimum parking, garden and permeance spaces (i.e. amount of water shedded/soaked) 
  - [ ] additional allowed space for 'unroofed' spaces: pools, spas, terraces, decks, ramps, pergolas, shade sail/umbrella, solar/fire shutter, water/fuel tanks, heating/cooling equipment and/or below ground structures
  - [ ] [optional] estimate additional extensions of building via verandas, pagodas, porches, gutters, eaves and fascia.
  - [ ] calculation of legal allowable daylight to existing habitable rooms, i.e. take a shadow diagram on 22nd September (equinox).
  - [ ] calculation for overshadowing of recreational and/or private open spaces
  - [ ] calculation for overlookking of proximal existing buildings

Other setback?
  - [ ] ventilation requirements?
